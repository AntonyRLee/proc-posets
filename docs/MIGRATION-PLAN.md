# procposets — migration & self-containment plan

Goal: procposets is a **standalone, independently-releasable** library (poset / cospan /
string-diagram calculation, simulation, estimation, comparison). Finish extracting all reusable
code out of the three consumer repos, delete every duplicate, and remove all consumer/pipeline
detail so the package stands alone. **procposets is NOT any paper's artifact** — it releases on its
own track; paper-specific coupling is leakage to remove, not release-gating.

Drafted 2026-07-22 from a 5-agent read-only audit of procposets + the three consumers.

---

## Status at a glance (verified against live repos 2026-07-22)

- **Internal 8-phase refactor: essentially COMPLETE** (Phases 0–7 landed) — but on the **unmerged
  branch `output-sensitive-extract-signature`** (tip `bc9e7c0`, 362 passed / 13 skipped). `main` is
  still **pre-refactor** at `3c4c503`. A release cannot be cut until this lands on `main`.
- **PMN** (`poset-mixture-npmle`): cut over. One 105-line shim, zero library logic. Aliases migrated
  on unmerged branch `arl/alias-cutover` (1 commit ahead of PMN `main` `6a6cd2b`).
- **SPM** (`stochastic_process_mining/experiments`): cut over. 43-line `spm/` shim, zero logic.
  5 demo/`paper_figures` scripts + 10 tests still import `spm.*`.
- **cpm** (`string-diagram-process-mining/sim`): **NOT ported.** Full ~9,475 LoC copy; ~211
  `from cpm…` sites in 62 files; the **last independent byte-exact oracle** for 13 goldens.

## The one hard sequencing constraint

`sim/cpm` is the last live oracle for the `procposets == cpm` cross-checks (`tests/test_golden_*`
+ parts of `tests/regression/test_cpm_*`). So: **move/verify every un-reproduced cpm module INTO
procposets (with a golden) while `cpm/` is still on disk → flip all imports → delete `cpm/` last →
then delete the scaffolds that pointed at it.** Nothing that deletes `cpm/` or a `*_matches_cpm`
scaffold may run before its replacement golden is green.

Risk tags (from the refactor plan): `none` (docstring/comment) · `value-preserving` · `changes-values`
(gate on full golden suite) · `api-breaking` (needs alias/coordinated bump) · `blocked` (on another step).

## Workstream 1 — Port the cpm consumer (only remaining *code* migration)

- [x] **1.1 Wire the dependency** — DONE (sim WS 1.1): `procposets[pm4py,viz]` + `[tool.uv.sources]`
  editable path added to `sim/pyproject.toml`; `uv sync` no longer wipes the editable install. `none`
- [x] **1.2 Move `cpm/simulate.py` (cospan→OCEL) into procposets, with a golden** — DONE 2026-07-22
  (`2f94c21`): landed as `procposets/cospan/simulate.py` behind `[pm4py]` (avoids the top-level
  `simulate.py` sampler clash); `test_golden_ocel` cross-check green. `changes-values`
- [x] **1.3 Move `cpm/faithful_simulate.py` + `cpm/discover.py` into procposets, with goldens** —
  DONE 2026-07-22 (`2f94c21`): `faithful_simulate`/`discover` ported behind `[pm4py]` with OCEL
  goldens; `splice_representation_from_signature` exposed as a library fn. `changes-values`
- [x] **1.4 Close 4 golden gaps for already-reproduced modules** — DONE 2026-07-22 (`e6cf885`,
  `tests/test_golden_analysis.py`, suite 370/13): `signature_diff`, `typebalance`, full
  `class_extraction` structural equality, `gamma_normalize`, and silent-elimination (the engine's
  `without_silent`/`remove_silent`, distinct from `degenerate_filtered`). All byte-exact ports, so the
  goldens lock procposets == live cpm before cpm is deleted. `none`
- [x] **1.5 Flip `from cpm.X` → `from procposets.X`** — DONE 2026-07-22 (sim `9d9aff9`, **42 files**,
  sim suite **209 passed on procposets**). Flipped the transitive-closed pure-library-consumer set;
  the viz split/`unroll` split/`cpm.simulate`→`cospan.simulate` collision all handled; adapted 3 api
  evolutions (`canonical_key`→`label_multiset_key`, viz `LayoutStyle` threading). **20 files kept on cpm**
  (glue-entangled + the build_running_example fixture cluster that shares a fixture with the glue-bound
  test_explain_split) → they flip in 1.7 when the glue relocates. `api-breaking`
- [x] **1.6 Repoint the manuscript figure chain** — DONE 2026-07-22 (sim `023b4ff`): only
  `ground_signature.py` + `test_master_signature.py` remained on cpm (the rest flipped in WS 1.5);
  flipped to procposets/demos.glue. `api-breaking`
- [x] **1.7 Relocate cpm pipeline/CLI glue OUT to `demos/glue/`** — DONE 2026-07-22 (sim `023b4ff`):
  10 glue modules (`pipeline/generate/spec/artifacts/report/conversion_consistency/binding_probe/`
  `signature_cli/splice_cli` + the `loop_family` worked example) relocated to `sim/demos/glue/`;
  core imports → procposets, glue↔glue stay relative. The 20 kept-on-cpm files flipped in lockstep
  (incl. the dynamic `__import__` in `test_dag_render`); adapted the `canonical_key`/viz-`LayoutStyle`/
  `unroll`-split API evolutions. `api-breaking`
- [x] **1.8 Retire the oracle suite** — DONE 2026-07-22: there is **no** `*_matches_cpm` suite; the
  real oracles are `occn_dev`/reference-based and already on procposets. Only fixed the stale
  `occn_dev/conftest.py` docstring. `none`
- [x] **1.9 Delete `sim/cpm/`** — DONE 2026-07-22 (sim `c3f75d8`): removed the bundled copy
  (7,834 LoC, 37 files). procposets is a proper editable dep in `sim/pyproject.toml` (WS 1.1), so
  no ad-hoc `.venv` install to drop. **sim suite 209 passed on procposets alone.** `blocked`→DONE

## Workstream 2 — Self-containment of procposets (in progress on branch `self-containment-sweep`)

- [x] **2.1 Strip consumer-doc provenance from source docstrings** — DONE 2026-07-22 (`2cb9e11`):
  ~40 consumer-doc refs, the `npmle.py` reverse-leak, and the `spm_viz.py` `cpm/vis.py` provenance
  all removed. Verified: the shipping tree (package source minus tests) now greps clean of every
  leak string — locked by the WS 4.3 release-gate test. `none`
- [~] **2.2 Golden-test decision (self-containment crux)** — KEEP `tests/regression/test_{cpm,np,spm}_*`
  as the library's behaviour contract (already self-contained). **cpm-side DONE** 2026-07-22 (`1b07b22`):
  the 5 `test_golden_{unroll,cospan,analysis,ocel,viz}.py` cpm cross-check scaffolds deleted with the
  oracle. **Remaining:** the np/spm-side goldens (`test_golden_{poset,estimation,extensions}`) — retire
  once PMN/SPM old modules are gone (WS 3); optional de-naming of the `test_cpm_*` prefixes.
  `value-preserving` / partial
- [x] **2.3 Rename `viz/spm_viz.py`** — DONE 2026-07-22 (`7df83a9`): renamed to
  `viz/signature_diagram.py`; consumer imports migrated in lockstep (sim flipped in WS 1.5). `api-breaking`
- [x] **2.4 Scope the `occn/` miner** — DONE 2026-07-22: kept in-library as a clearly-labelled optional
  **inbound adapter** (added a Scope note to `occn/__init__.py`); already out of the top-level `__all__`,
  imports no third-party libs, and the numpy-free core neither imports nor depends on it. Docstring-only,
  so **no value change**. `changes-values`→none
- [ ] **2.5 Promote SPM-reached privates to public** — `discrete._alphabet`, `matrix._block_sequence`,
  `equivalence._activity_pomsets` (SPM imports these). `value-preserving`
- [x] **2.6 Remove leftover compat shims** — DONE 2026-07-22: deleted the root `procposets/equivalence.py`
  shim and the `is_boundary_label = is_gamma_or_marker` alias. Re-pointed every consumer in lockstep
  (name-identical): sim ×2 (`is_boundary_label`→`is_gamma_or_marker`), PMN ×3 + SPM ×4
  (`procposets.equivalence`→`procposets.cospan.equivalence`), plus the `test_lazy_numpy` witness and
  the now-obsolete alias-identity regression test. Kept the intentional public aliases
  (`count_linear_extensions`, `Model`). Suites green: procposets 336, sim 209, PMN 201, SPM 54.
  `api-breaking`→DONE

## Workstream 3 — Finish PMN & SPM (small)

- [x] **3.1 PMN: merge `arl/alias-cutover`** — DONE 2026-07-22: fixed `CLAUDE.md` "107 tests"→"201 tests"
  (`3b2b976`; verified `uv run pytest` = 201 passed). Branch merge to PMN `main` handled in WS 4.4.
  `value-preserving`
- [x] **3.2 SPM: re-point 5 scripts + 10 tests** — DONE 2026-07-22 (SPM `c5161f2`): all 15 `spm.*`
  consumers re-pointed to `procposets.*` (1:1 names; `spm.viz`→`procposets.viz.signature_diagram`).
  Kept the 8 procposets-mirrored tests as consumer smoke coverage. `value-preserving`
- [x] **3.3 SPM: delete `spm/viz.py` + the `spm/` shim** — DONE 2026-07-22 (SPM `c5161f2`): removed the
  `experiments/spm/` shim + its wheel-packaging (spm-sandbox is now `[tool.uv] package = false`);
  de-staled `experiments/README.md` (`spm/` paths→`procposets/`, dropped the "reusable library" claim).
  SPM suite: 54 passed. `none`

## Workstream 4 — Independent-release hygiene

- [x] **4.1 Add a LICENSE** — DONE 2026-07-22: MIT `LICENSE` (© Antony Lee) + `pyproject` metadata
  (`license = "MIT"`, `license-files`, `authors`, `[project.urls]`, classifiers). Wheel builds; METADATA
  carries `License-Expression: MIT` + `licenses/LICENSE`. `none`
- [x] **4.2 Ship `procposets/py.typed`** — DONE 2026-07-22: PEP 561 marker added + `Typing :: Typed`
  classifier; verified present in the built wheel (`procposets/py.typed`). `none`
- [x] **4.3 Add a release-gate grep** — DONE 2026-07-22 (`procposets/tests/test_release_gate.py`):
  scans the shipping tree (package source minus `tests/`) and fails on `/home/arl`, `sim/cpm`,
  the three consumer repo names, and the consumer-doc filenames. Currently green. `none`
- [ ] **4.4 Merge `output-sensitive-extract-signature` → `main`** — everything above assumes the
  refactor is mainline; it currently isn't. (Owner decision.) `none`
- [~] **4.5 (open Phase-0 latents)** — PARTIAL 2026-07-22. **Import side effect DONE (value-preserving):**
  `adapters/outbound.py` no longer calls a module-level `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")` (which
  silenced warnings process-wide for anyone importing the [pm4py] layer); scoped to just the pandas/pm4py
  imports via `warnings.catch_warnings()`. **DEFERRED pending owner sign-off** (they change research
  numerics + the frozen regression goldens, so not touched unilaterally):
    1. `compose.py` LoopBox dedup — the `seen`-key may not distinguish LoopBox placements, so composites
       differing only in a loop box can wrongly dedup (or fail to).
    2. `morphism_schema.py` — a `Counter(g.left)`/`Counter(g.right)` reads port multiplicity but a
       boundary tally may be unweighted where it should carry `c`.
    3. `simulate.py:91` `alphabet = sorted(mix.trees[0].elements())` — the sampler takes the alphabet
       from ONLY the first mixture component; components with a different element set lose elements.
  Also **DEFERRED (environmental):** `viz/signature_diagram.py:20` `matplotlib.use("Agg")` forces the
  backend at import (overrides a consumer's choice); removing it risks breaking headless demos, so leave
  for a deliberate call. `changes-values` / `value-preserving`

### NOT procposets' concern (push to the geometry-paper repo)
Split-Miner anomaly investigation · supplement reproduction commands · the Zenodo DOI "to pin in the
paper." These are consumer/paper items. (The one real library item in that TODO section — fleet-wide
`|X|` in `distance.py` — is already done on `main` at `3a62e18`.)

### What stays OUT of the library (consumer drivers, keep in place)
cpm pipeline/CLI glue (→ `sim/demos/`) · SPM exhibit/figure scripts + Split-Miner baseline · PMN
benchmark drivers · all three repos' demos. The library exposes the primitives these call.

## Recommended order
2.1 (in progress) → 1.1 + 2.5 + 3.1/3.2 (safe, unblock) → 1.2–1.4 (move cpm logic in, with goldens) →
1.5–1.7 (flip imports, relocate glue) → 1.8–1.9 (delete cpm) → 2.2/2.6 scaffold+shim removal →
4.x release hygiene → 4.4 merge to `main`.
